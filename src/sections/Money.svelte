    <p>
      It’s hard to give a number. Total cost of a project depends on many factors. 
      What is the scale of the project, how much time will it cost, does design work have to be done, how many developers will be required, what are the performance requirements, et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind, developers are expensive, especially good ones. 
      A conservative estimate for a month of work is around $30,000. Most projects take around 3-4 months, putting the total cost at $90,000-$120,000.

      Most startups, however, do not have this kind of capital. 
      Especially if they are just starting out. We understand this, so pitch us your idea, with validation, and we will allow you to pay part of the costs with equity. 
      The amount of equity will be decided based on the current valuation of your startup, among other factors.
