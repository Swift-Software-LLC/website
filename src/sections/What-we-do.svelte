      <h1>Building</h1>
      <p>We know being first to market is important. And we know how to build good software. We will turn your idea into a real product, that your users will love.</p>
      <p>We use a modern tech stack, focused on quick development, extendability and security. Building something quickly does not mean we slack on code quality, speed, and security.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid__item">
      <h1>Rapid Feedback</h1>
      <p>To make sure we build exactly what you envision, we maintain a constant communication channel. We believe great communication is at the core of every great product. </p>
      <p>We work using Scrum and Agile, in sprints of two weeks, at the end of which we have an improved, and working product.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid__item">
      <h1>Delivery</h1>
      <p>Once you are happy with the product, we help you serve it to your first users. If there are big bugs or issues we will of course fix them.</p>
      <p>After this, we provide no more development work. Now itâ€™s your turn to build out your own software team, and to really accelerate the growth of your startup!</p>
