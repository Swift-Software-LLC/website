          <h1>Reduced risk</h1>
          <p>
            Building a full-featured product, only to find out there is no market for it, sucks.
            We focus on building a product with the vital features needed to test your product's main assumptions.

        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Reduced cost</h1>
          <p>
            By building a product with only the vital features, not only the risk is reduced, the cost is as well.
            Maintenance costs will also be reduced, less features means less maintentance.
          </p>

        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Time to market</h1>
          <p>We know being first to market can be very important. By building a MVP you will reduce development time, and beat your competitors to market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Growth</h1>
          <p>A MVP is the easiest way to quickly grow your business. By validating your idea, and getting your first users on board, venture capital will be much easier to obtain.</p>
