          <p>
            Building a full-featured product, only to find out there is no market for it, sucks.
            We focus on building a product with the vital features needed to test your product's main assumptions.

        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Reduced cost</h1>
          <p>
            By building a product with only the vital features, not only the risk is reduced, but the cost is as well.
            Maintenance costs will also be reduced, less features means less maintentance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Time to market</h1>
          <p>We know being first to market can be very important. By building a MVP you will reduce development time, and beat your competitors to market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Growth</h1>
          <p>A MVP is the easiest way to quickly grow your business. By validating your idea, and getting your first users on board, venture capital will be much easier to obtain.</p>

          <h1>Build</h1>
          <p>We know being first to market is important. And we know how to build good software. We will turn your idea into a real product, that your users will love.</p>
          <p>We use a modern tech stack, focused on quick development, extendability and security. Building something quickly does not mean we slack on code quality, speed, and security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Improve</h1>
          <p>To make sure we build exactly what you envision, we maintain a constant communication channel. We believe great communication is at the core of every great product. </p>
          <p>We work using Scrum and Agile, in sprints of two weeks, at the end of which we have an improved, and working product.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid__item">
          <h1>Deliver</h1>
          <p>Once you are happy with the product, we help you serve it to your first users. Any big bugs or issues, we will of course fix.</p>
          <p>After this, we provide no more development work. Now itâ€™s your turn to build out your own software team, and to really accelerate the growth of your startup!</p>

        <h1>Intro Call</h1>
        <p>We begin with a fairly short introduction call where we learn about your idea, what you want us to build, and other project parameters.</p>
        <p>Based on this introduction call we will give a cost and time estimate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline__item">
        <h1>Requirements Gathering</h1>
        <p>In a focus session with you we formulate the list of requirements. Based on these specific requirements we will give the final cost, and time the project will take.</p>

      <div class="timeline__item">
        <h1>User Interface</h1>
        <p>If we are tasked with designing the MVP as well, we will begin with the most important screens. We will design these screens in a few styles.</p>
        <p>Based on your feedback we will choose a style for the MVP, and design the rest of the application.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline__item">
        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>We develop the MVP. We do this in bi-weekly increments, meaning there is an updated application every two weeks. We do this so your feedback can be incorporated often, and quickly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline__item">
        <h1>Delivery</h1>

      <h1 class="header">Sounds great! But, how much does it cost?</h1>
      <p>
        It's hard to give a concrete number, as the cost for a MVP depends on many different factors.
        Larger, more complex projects will logically cost more than simple one page applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        A month of development time costs around $20,000. A simple MVP can be made in less than a month, more complex MVP's take longer.

      <p>
        As we know, many startups, especially those in the pre-seed phase, don't have this kind of capital.
        This is why we offer <span class="gradient-text">part payment in the form of equity</span>. Think of it as a non-monetary investment into your startup.
